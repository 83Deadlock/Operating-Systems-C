# Operating-Systems-C

Practical work on Operating Systems, course unit of the 2nd year of the Integrated Master in Computer Engineering at Univerisdade do Minho.

The project is a command execution interface between one or more clients and a server.

In this repository, all files referring to this work are present, as well as the Makefile that automates the compilation and creation / removal of files necessary for the execution of the program.

To execute, just run the Makefile (using the command "make all") and execute - in two different terminals - first the executable "argusd" and then "argus", the second one can be executed with or without arguments, reacting differently to both situations.

The project development report is also found in the repository with brief explanations of how each feature was developed.
